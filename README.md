**🌿 Plant Leaf Disease Detection 🍃🍂**

Detect plant leaf diseases using deep learning and image classification — with a simple web interface for instant results.

⸻

**📝 PROJECT OVERVIEW**

Plant Leaf Disease Detection is a machine learning-based project that classifies plant leaf images as healthy or diseased using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system offers a lightweight web interface for seamless interaction, making it ideal for farmers, researchers, and students to facilitate early disease detection and crop protection.

**🧠 MODEL DETAILS**
	•	Model Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
	•	Dataset: Public plant disease datasets (e.g., PlantVillage)
	•	Classes: Healthy, Powdery Mildew, Leaf Spot, Rust, etc.
	•	Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras
	•	Training Accuracy: ~95% (may vary by dataset)

⸻

**🛠️ TECH STACK**
	•	🐍 Python
	•	🔶 TensorFlow / Keras
	•	⚙️ Flask (for web deployment)
	•	💻 Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
	•	🌐 HTML / CSS (for frontend)

**🚀 HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT**
	1.	Run the Main Notebook
Open and run Plant_Leaf_Diseases_Detection.ipynb to load libraries and the trained model.
	2.	Upload Sample Images
Provide the path to your test leaf images or upload them (if using Colab).
	3.	Run Output Notebook
Execute Plant_Leaf_Disease_Detector_Output.ipynb to get predictions and generate a web interface.
	4.	Access Web Page
Click the generated link to view results in a clean, web-based format.
